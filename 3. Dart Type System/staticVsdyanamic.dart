// Dart is static language because we have to define type of variable

//in python and javascropt they are dyanmic bcoz they dont have type checker at runtime

//it run without defining the type
// dart gives errror before run if we dont defined the type to variables

// example

void main(){
  String a='hello';
  // a='hello'; it will give erro bcoz we have to define the variable type
}
